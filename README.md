EOS - A HEP Program for Flavor Observables
==========================================

EOS is a software package that addresses several use cases in the field of
high-energy flavor physics:

 - calculation and uncertainty estimation of flavor observables within
   various models, and
 - Bayesian inference of parameters from experimental and/or theoretical
   constraints.

EOS is written in C++, and relies on as a small set of dependencies:

 - GNU Scientific Library
 - Hierarchical Data Format v5 (HDF5)
 - Minuit2 v5 (or greater)
 - libPMC (optional)
